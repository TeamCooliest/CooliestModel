# 2. FixedTopWall

icoFoam

# 3. FixedTopWall2

icoFoam

# 4. flow-over-heated-plate

rhoPimpleFoam

from tutorial with small changes

# 5. heatedplate1

rhoPimpleFoam, adapted from #4 to square blockmesh

# 6. heatedplate2

rhoPimpleFoam, adapted from #5 to modify

# 7. heatedplate3

rhoPimpleFoam, moved from externalHeatFlux... to fixedGradient (boundary condition)

# 8. heatedplate4

more defined blockmesh and run for 1 second (opposed to .3 s)

# 9 FixedTopWall3

blockmesh is now 6by1 instead of 1by1. This to find where the flow fully develops
